A basic battery level notifier.

It checks sysfs entry for BAT0 every $SLEEP_LONG, if you are discharging, it 
then checks if the % is < 5, then < 1. If < 5, it notifies you via `wall`, if
< 1, it shuts down your computer. As a result, the user it runs from needs to 
be able to run `shutdown -Ph now`.

Note: This does not notify you via any GUI popups. Nor will it work in a
terminal emulator by itself. GNU screen and tty's will pick up the notification.

Tested in bash v. 4.2.
Dependencies:
	acpi kernel support
	bc
	shutdown
	sysfs
	wall
